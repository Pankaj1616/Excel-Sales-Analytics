Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident casualties using a dataset obtained from an online source. The goal was to clean, analyze, and visualize the data to gain insights into accident patterns and trends.

Key Steps in the Project:
Data Cleaning:

Performed Find and Replace to correct data inconsistencies.
Added new columns such as Year and Month by extracting data from date fields.
Data Analysis:

Created Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for:
Total Casualties
Fatal Casualties
Serious Casualties
Slight Casualties
Casualties by Vehicle Type
Identified the vehicle type with the largest number of accidents (Cars).
Visualizations:

Trends Analysis:
Compared Current Year vs Last Year's casualties trend by month.
Casualties Breakdown:
Casualties by Road Type (e.g., Highways, Residential Roads).
Casualties by Road Surface (e.g., Wet, Dry).
Casualties by Location/Area (Urban vs Rural):
Found that urban areas have more accidents compared to rural areas.
Light Condition Analysis:
Found more accidents occur during the daytime than at night.
Filter Panel:

Added filters for dynamic analysis:
Year-wise, Month-wise, and Quarter-wise filtering.
Area-wise filtering (Urban vs Rural).

Insights:
Vehicle Type: Cars are involved in the largest number of accidents.
Urban Areas: Accidents are significantly higher in urban areas than rural.
Daytime: Majority of accidents occur during the day.
